happy
families
are
all
alike

every
unhappy
family
is
unhappy
in
its
own
way


everything
was
in
confusion
in
the
oblonskys
house


the
wife
had
discovered
that
the
husband
was
carrying
on
an
intrigue
with
a
french
girl

who
had
been
a
governess
in
their
family

and
she
had
announced
to
her
husband
that
she
could
not
go
on
living
in
the
same
house
with
him


this
position
of
affairs
had
now
lasted
three
days

and
not
only
the
husband
and
wife
themselves

but
all
the
members
of
their
family
and
household

were
painfully
conscious
of
it


every
person
in
the
house
felt
that
there
was
so
sense
in
their
living
together

and
that
the
stray
people
brought
together
by
chance
in
any
inn
had
more
in
common
with
one
another
than
they

the
members
of
the
family
and
household
of
the
oblonskys


the
wife
did
not
leave
her
own
room

the
husband
had
not
been
at
home
for
three
days


the
children
ran
wild
all
over
the
house

the
english
governess
quarreled
with
the
housekeeper

and
wrote
to
a
friend
asking
her
to
look
out
for
a
new
situation
for
her

the
mancook
had
walked
off
the
day
before
just
at
dinner
time

the
kitchenmaid

and
the
coachman
had
given
warning


three
days
after
the
quarrel

prince
stepan
arkadyevitch
oblonskystiva

as
he
was
called
in
the
fashionable
world
woke
up
at
his
usual
hour

that
is

at
eight
oclock
in
the
morning

not
in
his
wifes
bedroom

but
on
the
leathercovered
sofa
in
his
study


he
turned
over
his
stout

wellcaredfor
person
on
the
springy
sofa

as
though
he
would
sink
into
a
long
sleep
again

he
vigorously
embraced
the
pillow
on
the
other
side
and
buried
his
face
in
it

but
all
at
once
he
jumped
up

sat
up
on
the
sofa

and
opened
his
eyes



yes

yes

how
was
it
now


he
thought

going
over
his
dream


now

how
was
it

to
be
sure

alabin
was
giving
a
dinner
at
darmstadt

no

not
darmstadt

but
something
american


yes

but
then

darmstadt
was
in
america


yes

alabin
was
giving
a
dinner
on
glass
tables

and
the
tables
sang

il
mio
tesoronot
il
mio
tesoro
though

but
something
better

and
there
were
some
sort
of
little
decanters
on
the
table

and
they
were
women

too


he
remembered


stepan
arkadyevitchs
eyes
twinkled
gaily

and
he
pondered
with
a
smile



yes

it
was
nice

very
nice


there
was
a
great
deal
more
that
was
delightful

only
theres
no
putting
it
into
words

or
even
expressing
it
in
ones
thoughts
awake


and
noticing
a
gleam
of
light
peeping
in
beside
one
of
the
serge
curtains

he
cheerfully
dropped
his
feet
over
the
edge
of
the
sofa

and
felt
about
with
them
for
his
slippers

a
present
on
his
last
birthday

worked
for
him
by
his
wife
on
goldcolored
morocco


and

as
he
had
done
every
day
for
the
last
nine
years

he
stretched
out
his
hand

without
getting
up

towards
the
place
where
his
dressinggown
always
hung
in
his
bedroom


and
thereupon
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
was
not
sleeping
in
his
wifes
room

but
in
his
study

and
why
the
smile
vanished
from
his
face

he
knitted
his
brows



ah

ah

ah


oo





he
muttered

recalling
everything
that
had
happened


and
again
every
detail
of
his
quarrel
with
his
wife
was
present
to
his
imagination

all
the
hopelessness
of
his
position

and
worst
of
all

his
own
fault



yes

she
wont
forgive
me

and
she
cant
forgive
me


and
the
most
awful
thing
about
it
is
that
its
all
my
faultall
my
fault

though
im
not
to
blame


thats
the
point
of
the
whole
situation


he
reflected



oh

oh

oh


he
kept
repeating
in
despair

as
he
remembered
the
acutely
painful
sensations
caused
him
by
this
quarrel


most
unpleasant
of
all
was
the
first
minute
when

on
coming

happy
and
goodhumored

from
the
theater

with
a
huge
pear
in
his
hand
for
his
wife

he
had
not
found
his
wife
in
the
drawingroom

to
his
surprise
had
not
found
her
in
the
study
either

and
saw
her
at
last
in
her
bedroom
with
the
unlucky
letter
that
revealed
everything
in
her
hand


she

his
dolly

forever
fussing
and
worrying
over
household
details

and
limited
in
her
ideas

as
he
considered

was
sitting
perfectly
still
with
the
letter
in
her
hand

looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
horror

despair

and
indignation



whats
this

this


she
asked

pointing
to
the
letter


and
at
this
recollection

stepan
arkadyevitch

as
is
so
often
the
case

was
not
so
much
annoyed
at
the
fact
itself
as
at
the
way
in
which
he
had
met
his
wifes
words


there
happened
to
him
at
that
instant
what
does
happen
to
people
when
they
are
unexpectedly
caught
in
something
very
disgraceful

he
did
not
succeed
in
adapting
his
face
to
the
position
in
which
he
was
placed
towards
his
wife
by
the
discovery
of
his
fault

instead
of
being
hurt

denying

defending
himself

begging
forgiveness

instead
of
remaining
indifferent
evenanything
would
have
been
better
than
what
he
did
dohis
face
utterly
involuntarily
reflex
spinal
action

reflected
stepan
arkadyevitch

who
was
fond
of
physiologyutterly
involuntarily
assumed
its
habitual

goodhumored

and
therefore
idiotic
smile


this
idiotic
smile
he
could
not
forgive
himself


catching
sight
of
that
smile

dolly
shuddered
as
though
at
physical
pain

broke
out
with
her
characteristic
heat
into
a
flood
of
cruel
words

and
rushed
out
of
the
room


since
then
she
had
refused
to
see
her
husband



its
that
idiotic
smile
thats
to
blame
for
it
all


thought
stepan
arkadyevitch



but
whats
to
be
done

whats
to
be
done


he
said
to
himself
in
despair

and
found
no
answer




chapter



stepan
arkadyevitch
was
a
truthful
man
in
his
relations
with
himself


he
was
incapable
of
deceiving
himself
and
persuading
himself
that
he
repented
of
his
conduct


he
could
not
at
this
date
repent
of
the
fact
that
he

a
handsome

susceptible
man
of
thirtyfour

was
not
in
love
with
his
wife

the
mother
of
five
living
and
two
dead
children

and
only
a
year
younger
than
himself


all
he
repented
of
was
that
he
had
not
succeeded
better
in
hiding
it
from
his
wife


but
he
felt
all
the
difficulty
of
his
position
and
was
sorry
for
his
wife

his
children

and
himself


possibly
he
might
have
managed
to
conceal
his
sins
better
from
his
wife
if
he
had
anticipated
that
the
knowledge
of
them
would
have
had
such
an
effect
on
her


he
had
never
clearly
thought
out
the
subject

but
he
had
vaguely
conceived
that
his
wife
must
long
ago
have
suspected
him
of
being
unfaithful
to
her

and
shut
her
eyes
to
the
fact


he
had
even
supposed
that
she

a
wornout
woman
no
longer
young
or
goodlooking

and
in
no
way
remarkable
or
interesting

merely
a
good
mother

ought
from
a
sense
of
fairness
to
take
an
indulgent
view


it
had
turned
out
quite
the
other
way



oh

its
awful

oh
dear

oh
dear

awful


stepan
arkadyevitch
kept
repeating
to
himself

and
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
be
done



and
how
well
things
were
going
up
till
now

how
well
we
got
on


she
was
contented
and
happy
in
her
children

i
never
interfered
with
her
in
anything

i
let
her
manage
the
children
and
the
house
just
as
she
liked


its
true
its
bad
her
having
been
a
governess
in
our
house


thats
bad


theres
something
common

vulgar

in
flirting
with
ones
governess


but
what
a
governess



he
vividly
recalled
the
roguish
black
eyes
of
mlle

roland
and
her
smile



but
after
all

while
she
was
in
the
house

i
kept
myself
in
hand


and
the
worst
of
it
all
is
that
shes
already


it
seems
as
if
illluck
would
have
it
so


oh

oh

but
what

what
is
to
be
done



there
was
no
solution

but
that
universal
solution
which
life
gives
to
all
questions

even
the
most
complex
and
insoluble

that
answer
is
one
must
live
in
the
needs
of
the
daythat
is

forget
oneself


to
forget
himself
in
sleep
was
impossible
now

at
least
till
nighttime

he
could
not
go
back
now
to
the
music
sung
by
the
decanterwomen

so
he
must
forget
himself
in
the
dream
of
daily
life



then
we
shall
see


stepan
arkadyevitch
said
to
himself

and
getting
up
he
put
on
a
gray
dressinggown
lined
with
blue
silk

tied
the
tassels
in
a
knot

and

drawing
a
deep
breath
of
air
into
his
broad

bare
chest

he
walked
to
the
window
with
his
usual
confident
step

turning
out
his
feet
that
carried
his
full
frame
so
easily


he
pulled
up
the
blind
and
rang
the
bell
loudly


it
was
at
once
answered
by
the
appearance
of
an
old
friend

his
valet

matvey

carrying
his
clothes

his
boots

and
a
telegram


matvey
was
followed
by
the
barber
with
all
the
necessaries
for
shaving



are
there
any
papers
form
the
office


asked
stepan
arkadyevitch

taking
the
telegram
and
seating
himself
at
the
lookingglass



on
the
table


replied
matvey

glancing
with
inquiring
sympathy
at
his
master

and

after
a
short
pause

he
added
with
a
sly
smile


theyve
sent
from
the
carriagejobbers



stepan
arkadyevitch
made
no
reply

he
merely
glanced
at
matvey
in
the
lookingglass


in
the
glance

in
which
their
eyes
met
in
the
lookingglass

it
was
clear
that
they
understood
one
another

stepan
arkadyevitchs
eyes
asked

why
do
you
tell
me
that

dont
you
know



matvey
put
his
hands
in
his
jacket
pockets

thrust
out
one
leg

and
gazed
silently

goodhumoredly

with
a
faint
smile

at
his
master



i
told
them
to
come
on
sunday

and
till
then
not
to
trouble
you
or
themselves
for
nothing


he
said


he
had
obviously
prepared
the
sentence
beforehand


stepan
arkadyevitch
saw
matvey
wanted
to
make
a
joke
and
attract
attention
to
himself


tearing
open
the
telegram

he
read
it
through

guessing
at
the
words

misspelt
as
they
always
are
in
telegrams

and
his
face
brightened



matvey

my
sister
anna
arkadyevna
will
be
here
tomorrow


he
said

checking
for
a
minute
the
sleek

plump
hand
of
the
barber

cutting
a
pink
path
through
his
long

curly
whiskers



thank
god


said
matvey

showing
by
this
response
that
he

like
his
master

realized
the
significance
of
this
arrivalthat
is

that
anna
arkadyevna

the
sister
he
was
so
fond
of

might
bring
about
a
reconciliation
between
husband
and
wife



alone

or
with
her
husband


inquired
matvey


stepan
arkadyevitch
could
not
answer

as
the
barber
was
at
work
on
his
upper
lip

and
he
raised
one
finger


matvey
nodded
at
the
lookingglass



alone


is
the
room
to
be
got
ready
upstairs

but
he
only
said


yes

stepan
arkadyevitch
was
already
washed
and
combed
and
ready
to
be
dressed

when
matvey

stepping
deliberately
in
his
creaky
boots

came
back
into
the
room
with
the
telegram
in
his
hand


the
barber

dothat

youas

likes


he
said

laughing
only
with
his
eyes

and
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets

he
watched
his
master
with
his
head
on
one
side


stepan
arkadyevitch
was
silent
a
minute


then
a
goodhumored
and
rather
pitiful
smile
showed
itself
on
his
handsome
face



eh

matvey


he
said

shaking
his
head



its
all
right

said
matvey



come

yes

sir




do
you
think
so

whos
there


asked
stepan
arkadyevitch

hearing
the
rustle
of
a
womans
dress
at
the
door



its
i


said
a
firm

pleasant

womans
voice

and
the
stern

pockmarked
face
of
matrona
philimonovna

the
nurse

was
thrust
in
at
the
doorway



well

what
is
it

matrona


queried
stepan
arkadyevitch

going
up
to
her
at
the
door


although
stepan
arkadyevitch
was
completely
in
the
wrong
as
regards
his
wife

and
was
conscious
of
this
himself

almost
every
one
in
the
house
even
the
nurse

darya
alexandrovnas
chief
ally
was
on
his
side



well

what
now


he
asked
disconsolately



go
to
her

fault

maybe
god

consequences






but
she

said
stepan
arkadyevitch

blushing
suddenly



well
now

do
dress
me


he
turned
to
matvey
and
threw
off
his
dressinggown
decisively


matvey
was
already
holding
up
the
shirt
like
a
horses
collar

and

blowing
off
some
invisible
speck

he
slipped
it
with
obvious
pleasure
over
the
wellgroomed
body
of
his
master




chapter



when
he
was
dressed

stepan
arkadyevitch
sprinkled
some
scent
on
himself

pulled
down
his
shirtcuffs

distributed
into
his
pockets
his
cigarettes

pocketbook

matches

and
watch
with
its
double
chain
and
seals

and
shaking
out
his
handkerchief

feeling
himself
clean

fragrant

healthy

and
physically
at
ease

in
spite
of
his
unhappiness

he
walked
with
a
slight
swing
on
each
leg
into
the
diningroom

where
coffee
was
already
waiting
for
him

and
beside
the
coffee

letters
and
papers
from
the
office


he
read
the
letters


one
was
very
unpleasant

from
a
merchant
who
was
buying
a
forest
on
his
wifes
property


to
sell
this
forest
was
absolutely
essential

but
at
present

until
he
was
reconciled
with
his
wife

the
subject
could
not
be
discussed

the
most
unpleasant
thing
of
all
was
that
his
pecuniary
interests
should
in
this
way
enter
into
the
question
of
his
reconciliation
with
his
wife


and
the
idea
that
he
might
be
let
on
by
his
interests

that
he
might
seek
a
reconciliation
with
his
wife
on
account
of
the
sale
of
the
forestthat
idea
hurt
him


when
he
had
finished
his
letters

stepan
arkadyevitch
moved
the
officepapers
close
to
him

rapidly
looked
through
two
pieces
of
business

made
a
few
notes
with
a
big
pencil

and
pushing
away
the
papers

turned
to
his
coffee


as
he
sipped
his
coffee

he
opened
a
still
damp
morning
paper

and
began
reading
it


stepan
arkadyevitch
took
in
and
read
a
liberal
paper

not
an
extreme
one

but
one
advocating
the
views
held
by
the
majority

and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
science

art

and
politics
had
no
special
interest
for
him

he
firmly
held
those
views
on
all
these
subjects
which
were
held
by
the
majority
and
by
his
paper

and
he
only
changed
them
when
the
majority
changed
themor

more
strictly
speaking

he
did
not
change
them

but
they
imperceptibly
changed
of
themselves
within
him


stepan
arkadyevitch
had
not
chosen
his
political
opinions
or
his
views

these
political
opinions
and
views
had
come
to
him
of
themselves

just
as
he
did
not
choose
the
shapes
of
his
hat
and
coat

but
simply
took
those
that
were
being
worn


and
for
him

living
in
a
certain
societyowing
to
the
need

ordinarily
developed
at
years
of
discretion

for
some
degree
of
mental
activityto
have
views
was
just
as
indispensable
as
to
have
a
hat


if
there
was
a
reason
for
his
preferring
liberal
to
conservative
views

which
were
held
also
by
many
of
his
circle

it
arose
not
from
his
considering
liberalism
more
rational

but
from
its
being
in
closer
accordance
with
his
manner
of
life


the
liberal
party
said
that
in
russia
everything
is
wrong

and
certainly
stepan
arkadyevitch
had
many
debts
and
was
decidedly
short
of
money


the
liberal
party
said
that
marriage
is
an
institution
quite
out
of
date

and
that
it
needs
reconstruction

and
family
life
certainly
afforded
stepan
arkadyevitch
little
gratification

and
forced
him
into
lying
and
hypocrisy

which
was
so
repulsive
to
his
nature


the
liberal
party
said

or
rather
allowed
it
to
be
understood

that
religion
is
only
a
curb
to
keep
in
check
the
barbarous
classes
of
the
people

and
stepan
arkadyevitch
could
not
get
through
even
a
short
service
without
his
legs
aching
from
standing
up

and
could
never
make
out
what
was
the
object
of
all
the
terrible
and
highflown
language
about
another
world
when
life
might
be
so
very
amusing
in
this
world

and
with
all
this

stepan
arkadyevitch

who
liked
a
joke

was
fond
of
puzzling
a
plain
man
by
saying
that
if
he
prided
himself
on
his
origin

he
ought
not
to
stop
at
rurik
and
disown
the
first
founder
of
his
familythe
monkey


and
so
liberalism
had
become
a
habit
of
stepan
arkadyevitchs

and
he
liked
his
newspaper

as
he
did
his
cigar
after
dinner

for
the
slight
fog
it
diffused
in
his
brain


he
read
the
leading
article

in
which
it
was
maintained
that
it
was
quite
senseless
in
our
day
to
raise
an
outcry
that
radicalism
was
threatening
to
swallow
up
all
conservative
elements

and
that
the
government
ought
to
take
measures
to
crush
the
revolutionary
hydra

that

on
the
contrary


in
our
opinion
the
danger
lies
not
in
that
fantastic
revolutionary
hydra

but
in
the
obstinacy
of
traditionalism
clogging
progress


etc


etc


he
read
another
article

too

a
financial
one

which
alluded
to
bentham
and
mill

and
dropped
some
innuendoes
reflecting
on
the
ministry


with
his
characteristic
quickwittedness
he
caught
the
drift
of
each
innuendo

divined
whence
it
came

at
whom
and
on
what
ground
it
was
aimed

and
that
afforded
him

as
it
always
did

a
certain
satisfaction


but
today
that
satisfaction
was
embittered
by
matrona
philimonovnas
advice
and
the
unsatisfactory
state
of
the
household


he
read

too

that
count
beist
was
rumored
to
have
left
for
wiesbaden

and
that
one
need
have
no
more
gray
hair

and
of
the
sale
of
a
light
carriage

and
of
a
young
person
seeking
a
situation

but
these
items
of
information
did
not
give
him

as
usual

a
quiet

ironical
gratification


having
finished
the
paper

a
second
cup
of
coffee
and
a
roll
and
butter

he
got
up

shaking
the
crumbs
of
the
roll
off
his
waistcoat

and

squaring
his
broad
chest

he
smiled
joyously

not
because
there
was
anything
particularly
agreeable
in
his
mindthe
joyous
smile
was
evoked
by
a
good
digestion


but
this
joyous
smile
at
once
recalled
everything
to
him

and
he
grew
thoughtful


two
childish
voices
stepan
arkadyevitch
recognized
the
voices
of
grisha

his
youngest
boy

and
tanya

his
eldest
girl
were
heard
outside
the
door


they
were
carrying
something

and
dropped
it



i
told
you
not
to
sit
passengers
on
the
roof


said
the
little
girl
in
english


there

pick
them
up




everythings
in
confusion


thought
stepan
arkadyevitch


there
are
the
children
running
about
by
themselves


and
going
to
the
door

he
called
them


they
threw
down
the
box

that
represented
a
train

and
came
in
to
their
father


the
little
girl

her
fathers
favorite

ran
up
boldly

embraced
him

and
hung
laughingly
on
his
neck

enjoying
as
she
always
did
the
smell
of
scent
that
came
from
his
whiskers


at
last
the
little
girl
kissed
his
face

which
was
flushed
from
his
stooping
posture
and
beaming
with
tenderness

loosed
her
hands

and
was
about
to
run
away
again

but
her
father
held
her
back



how
is
mamma


he
asked

passing
his
hand
over
his
daughters
smooth

soft
little
neck



good
morning


he
said

smiling
to
the
boy

who
had
come
up
to
greet
him


he
was
conscious
that
he
loved
the
boy
less

and
always
tried
to
be
fair

but
the
boy
felt
it

and
did
not
respond
with
a
smile
to
his
fathers
chilly
smile



mamma


she
is
up


answered
the
girl


stepan
arkadyevitch
sighed



that
means
that
shes
not
slept
again
all
night


he
thought



well

is
she
cheerful



the
little
girl
knew
that
there
was
a
quarrel
between
her
father
and
mother

and
that
her
mother
could
not
be
cheerful

and
that
her
father
must
be
aware
of
this

and
that
he
was
pretending
when
he
asked
about
it
so
lightly


and
she
blushed
for
her
father

he
at
once
perceived
it

and
blushed
too



i
dont
know


she
said



she
did
not
say
we
must
do
our
lessons

but
she
said
we
were
to
go
for
a
walk
with
miss
hoole
to
grandmammas




well

go

tanya

my
darling


oh

wait
a
minute

though


he
said

still
holding
her
and
stroking
her
soft
little
hand


he
took
off
the
mantelpiece

where
he
had
put
it
yesterday

a
little
box
of
sweets

and
gave
her
two

picking
out
her
favorites

a
chocolate
and
a
fondant



for
grisha


said
the
little
girl

pointing
to
the
chocolate



yes

yes


and
still
stroking
her
little
shoulder

he
kissed
her
on
the
roots
of
here
hair
and
neck

and
let
her
go



the
carriage
is
ready


said
matvey


but
theres
some
one
to
see
you
with
a
petition




been
here
long


asked
stepan
arkadyevitch



half
an
hour




how
many
times
have
i
told
you
to
tell
me
at
once




one
must
let
you
drink
your
coffee
in
peace

at
least


said
matvey

in

frowning
with

the
petitioner

the
widow
of
a
staff
captain
kalinin

came
with
a
request
impossible
and
unreasonable

but
stepan
arkadyevitch

as
he
generally
did

made
her
sit
down

heard
her
to
the
end
attentively
without
interrupting
her

and
gave
her
detailed
advice
as
to
how
and
to
whom
to
apply

and
even
wrote
her

in
his
large

sprawling

good
and
legible
hand

a
confident
and
fluent
little
note
to
a
personage
who
might
be
of
use
to
her


having
got
rid
of
the
staff
captains
widow

stepan
arkadyevitch
took
his
hat
and
stopped
to
recollect
whether
he
had
forgotten
anything


it
appeared
that
he
had
forgotten
nothing
except
what
he
wanted
to
forgethis
wife



ah

yes



he
bowed
his
head

and
his
handsome
face
assumed
a
harassed
expression



to
go

or
not
to
go


he
said
to
himself

and
an
inner
voice
told
him
he
must
not
go

that
nothing
could
come
of
it
but
falsity

that
to
amend

to
set
right
their
relations
was
impossible

because
it
was
impossible
to
make
her
attractive
again
and
able
to
inspire
love

or
to
make
him
an
old
man

not
susceptible
to
love


except
deceit
and
lying
nothing
could
come
of
it
now

and
deceit
and
lying
were
opposed
to
his
nature



it
must
be
some
time

though

it
cant
go
on
like
this


he
said

trying
to
give
himself
courage


he
squared
his
chest

took
out
a
cigarette

took
two
whiffs
at
it

flung
it
into
a
motherofpearl
ashtray

and
with
rapid
steps
walked
through
the
drawing
room

alexandrovna

in
a
dressing
jacket

and
with
her
now
scanty

once
luxuriant
and
beautiful
hair
fastened
up
with
hairpins
on
the
nape
of
her
neck

with
a
sunken

thin
face
and
large

startled
eyes

which
looked
prominent
from
the
thinness
of
her
face

was
standing
among
a
litter
of
all
sorts
of
things
scattered
all
over
the
room

before
an
open
bureau

from
which
she
was
taking
something


hearing
her
husbands
steps

she
stopped

looking
towards
the
door

and
trying
assiduously
to
give
her
features
a
severe
and
contemptuous
expression


she
felt
she
was
afraid
of
him

and
afraid
of
the
coming
interview


she
was
just
attempting
to
do
what
she
had
attempted
to
do
ten
times
already
in
these
last
three
daysto
sort
out
the
childrens
things
and
her
own

so
as
to
take
them
to
her
mothersand
again
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
do
this

but
now
again

as
each
time
before

she
kept
saying
to
herself


that
things
cannot
go
on
like
this

that
she
must
take
some
step

to
punish
him

put
him
to
shame

avenge
on
him
some
little
part
at
least
of
the
suffering
he
had
caused
her


she
still
continued
to
tell
herself
that
she
should
leave
him

but
she
was
conscious
that
this
was
impossible

it
was
impossible
because
she
could
not
get
out
of
the
habit
of
regarding
him
as
her
husband
and
loving
him

besides
this

she
realized
that
if
even
here
in
her
own
house
she
could
hardly
manage
to
look
after
her
five
children
properly

they
would
be
still
worse
off
where
she
was
going
with
them
all

as
it
was

even
in
the
course
of
these
three
days

the
youngest
was
unwell
from
being
given
unwholesome
soup

and
the
others
had
almost
gone
without
their
dinner
the
day
before


she
was
conscious
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
away

but

cheating
herself

she
went
on
all
the
same
sorting
out
her
things
and
pretending
she
was
going


seeing
her
husband

she
dropped
her
hands
into
the
drawer
of
the
bureau
as
though
looking
for
something

and
only
looked
round
at
him
when
he
had
come
quite
up
to
her


but
her
face

to
which
she
tried
to
give
a
severe
and
resolute
expression

betrayed
bewilderment
and
suffering



dolly


he
said
in
a
subdued
and
timid
voice


he
bent
his
head
towards
his
shoulder
and
tried
to
look
pitiful
and
humble

but
for
all
that
he
was
radiant
with
freshness
and
health


in
a
rapid
glance
she
scanned
his
figure
that
beamed
with
health
and
freshness



yes

he
is
happy
and
content


she
thought


while
i





and
that
disgusting
good
nature

which
every
one
likes
him
for
and
praisesi
hate
that
good
nature
of
his


she
thought

her
mouth
stiffened

the
muscles
of
the
cheek
contracted
on
the
right
side
of
her
pale

nervous
face



what
do
you
want


she
said
in
a
rapid

deep

unnatural
voice



dolly


he
repeated

with
a
quiver
in
his
voice



anna
is
coming
today




well

what
is
that
to
me


i
cant
see
her


she
cried



but
you
must

really

dolly






go
away

go
away

go
away


she
shrieked

not
looking
at
him

as
though
this
shriek
were
called
up
by
physical
pain


stepan
arkadyevitch
could
be
calm
when
he
thought
of
his
wife

he
could
hope
that
she
would
come
round

as
matvey
expressed
it

and
could
quietly
go
on
reading
his
paper
and
drinking
his
coffee

but
when
he
saw
her
tortured

suffering
face

heard
the
tone
of
her
voice

submissive
to
fate
and
full
of
despair

there
was
a
catch
in
his
breath
and
a
lump
in
his
throat

and
his
eyes
began
to
shine
with
tears



my
god

what
have
i
done

dolly


for
gods
sake






you
know






he
could
not
go
on

there
was
a
sob
in
his
throat


she
shut
the
bureau
with
a
slam

and
glanced
at
him



dolly

what
can
i
say






one
thing
forgive


remember

cannot
nine
years
of
my
life
atone
for
an
instant






she
dropped
her
eyes
and
listened

expecting
what
he
would
say

as
it
were
beseeching
him
in
some
way
or
other
to
make
her
believe
differently



instant
of
passion


he
said

and
would
have
gone
on

but
at
that
word

as
at
a
pang
of
physical
pain

her
lips
stiffened
again

and
again
the
muscles
of
her
right
cheek
worked



go
away

go
out
of
the
room


she
shrieked
still
more
shrilly


and
dont
talk
to
me
of
your
passion
and
your
loathsomeness



she
tried
to
go
out

but
tottered

and
clung
to
the
back
of
a
chair
to
support
herself


his
face
relaxed

his
lips
swelled

his
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears



dolly


he
said

sobbing
now


for
mercys
sake

think
of
the
children

they
are
not
to
blame


i

and

me
expiate
my
fault

can
express
how
much
i
am
to
blame


but

dolly

forgive
me



she
sat
down


he
listened
to
her
hard

heavy
breathing

and
he
was
unutterably
sorry
for
her


she
tried
several
times
to
begin
to
speak

but
could
not


he
waited



you
remember
the
children

stiva

to
play
with
them

but
i
remember
them

and
know
that
this
means
their
ruin


she
saidobviously
one
of
the
phrases
she
had
more
than
once
repeated
to
herself
in
the
course
of
the
last
few
days


she
had
called
him

stiva


and
he
glanced
at
her
with
gratitude

and
moved
to
take
her
hand

but
she
drew
back
from
him
with
aversion



i
think
of
the
children

and
for
that
reason
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
to
save
them

but
i
dont
myself
know
how
to
save
them


by
taking
them
away
from
their
father

or
by
leaving
them
with

she
repeated

raising
her
voice


after
my
husband

father
of
my
children

enters
into
a

but
what
could
i
do

what
could

do


he
kept
saying
in
a
pitiful
voice

not
knowing
what
he
was
saying

as
his
head
sank
lower
and
lower



you
are
loathsome
to
me

repulsive


she
shrieked

getting
more
and
more
heated



your
tears
mean
nothing


you
have
never
loved
me

you
have
neither

nor

pain
and
wrath
she
uttered
the
word
so
terrible
to
herselfstranger


he
looked
at
her

and
the
fury
expressed
in
her
face
alarmed
and
amazed
him


he
did
not
understand
how
his
pity
for
her
exasperated
her


she
saw
in
him
sympathy
for
her

but
not
love


no

she
hates
me


she
will
not
forgive
me


he
thought



it
is
awful

awful


he
said


at
that
moment
in
the
next
room
a
child
began
to
cry

probably
it
had
fallen
down


darya
alexandrovna
listened

and
her
face
suddenly
softened


she
seemed
to
be
pulling
herself
together
for
a
few
seconds

as
though
she
did
not
know
where
she
was

and
what
she
was
doing

and
getting
up
rapidly

she
moved
towards
the
door



well

she
loves
my
child


he
thought

noticing
the
change
of
her
face
at
the
childs
cry


my
child
how
can
she
hate
me




dolly

one
word
more


he
said

following
her



if
you
come
near
me

i
will
call
in
the
servants

the
children

they
may
all
know
you
are
a
scoundrel


i
am
going
away
at
once

and
you
may
live
here
with
your
mistress



and
she
went
out

slamming
the
door


stepan
arkadyevitch
sighed

wiped
his
face

and
with
a
subdued
tread
walked
out
of
the
room



matvey
says
she
will
come
round

but
how


i
dont
see
the
least
chance
of
it


ah

oh

how
horrible
it
is


and
how
vulgarly
she
shouted


he
said
to
himself

remembering
her
shriek
and
the
words
scoundrel

and

mistress




and
very
likely
the
maids
were
listening


horribly
vulgar

horrible



stepan
arkadyevitch
stood
a
few
seconds
alone

wiped
his
face

squared
his
chest

and
walked
out
of
the
room


it
was
friday

and
in
the
dining
room
the
german
watchmaker
was
winding
up
the
clock


stepan
arkadyevitch
remembered
his
joke
about
this
punctual

bald
watchmaker


that
the
german
was
wound
up
for
a
whole
lifetime
himself

to
wind
up
watches


and
he
smiled


stepan
arkadyevitch
was
fond
of
a
joke

and
maybe
she
will
come
round


thats
a
good
expression

come
round


he
thought



i
must
repeat
that




matvey



he
shouted



arrange
everything
with
darya
in
the
sitting
room
for
anna
arkadyevna


he
said
to
matvey
when
he
came
in



yes

sir



stepan
arkadyevitch
put
on
his
fur
coat
and
went
out
onto
the
steps



you
wont
dine
at
home


said
matvey

seeing
him
off



thats
as
it
happens


but
heres
for
the
housekeeping


he
said

taking
ten
roubles
from
his
pocketbook



thatll
be
enough




enough
or
not
enough

we
must
make
it
do


said
matvey

slamming
the
carriage
door
and
stepping
back
onto
the
steps


darya
alexandrovna
meanwhile
having
pacified
the
child

and
knowing
from
the
sound
of
the
carriage
that
he
had
gone
off

went
back
again
to
her
bedroom


it
was
her
solitary
refuge
from
the
household
cares
which
crowded
upon
her
directly
she
went
out
from
it


even
now

in
the
short
time
she
had
been
in
the
nursery

the
english
governess
and
matrona
philimonovna
had
succeeded
in
putting
several
questions
to
her

which
did
not
admit
of
delay

and
which
only
she
could
answer

what
were
the
children
to
put
on
for
their
walk


should
they
have
any
milk


should
not
a
new
cook
be
sent
for




ah

let
me
alone

let
me
alone


she
said

and
going
back
to
her
bedroom
she
sat
down
in
the
same
place
as
she
had
sat
when
talking
to
her
husband

clasping
tightly
her
thin
hands
with
the
rings
that
slipped
down
on
her
bony
fingers

and
fell
to
going
over
in
her
memory
all
the
conversation



he
has
gone


but
has
he
broken
it
off
with
her


she
thought



can
it
be
he
sees
her

why
didnt
i
ask
him


no

no

reconciliation
is
impossible

even
if
we
remain
in
the
same
house

we
are
strangersstrangers
forever



she
repeated
again
with
special
significance
the
word
so
dreadful
to
her



and
how
i
loved
him

my
god

how
i
loved
him






how
i
loved
him


and
now
dont
i
love
him


dont
i
love
him
more
than
before


the
most
horrible
thing
is


she
began

but
did
not
finish
her
thought

because
matrona
philimonovna
put
her
head
in
at
the
door



let
us
send
for
my
brother


she
said


he
can
get
a
dinner
anyway

or
we
shall
have
the
children
getting
nothing
to
eat
till
six
again

like
yesterday




very
well

i
will
come
directly
and
see
about
it


but
did
you
send
for
some
new
milk



and
darya
alexandrovna
plunged
into
the
duties
of
the
day

and
drowned
her
grief
in
them
for
a
time

stepan
arkadyevitch
had
learned
easily
at
school

thanks
to
his
excellent
abilities

but
he
had
been
idle
and
mischievous

and
therefore
was
one
of
the
lowest
in
his
class


but
in
spite
of
his
habitually
dissipated
mode
of
life

his
inferior
grade
in
the
service

and
his
comparative
youth

he
occupied
the
honorable
and
lucrative
position
of
president
of
one
of
the
government
boards
at
moscow


this
post
he
had
received
through
his
sister
annas
husband

alexey
alexandrovitch
karenin

who
held
one
of
the
most
important
positions
in
the
ministry
to
whose
department
the
moscow
office
belonged


but
if
karenin
had
not
got
his
brother
inlaw
this
berth

then
through
a
hundred
other
personages
brothers

sisters

cousins

uncles

and
auntsstiva
oblonsky
would
have
received
this
post

or
some
other
similar
one

together
with
the
salary
of
six
thousand
absolutely
needful
for
them

as
his
affairs

in
spite
of
his
wifes
considerable
property

were
in
an
embarrassed
condition


half
moscow
and
petersburg
were
friends
and
relations
of
stepan
arkadyevitch


he
was
born
in
the
midst
of
those
who
had
been
and
are
the
powerful
ones
of
this
world


onethird
of
the
men
in
the
government

the
older
men

had
been
friends
of
his
fathers

and
had
known
him
in
petticoats

another
third
were
his
intimate
chums

and
the
remainder
were
friendly
acquaintances

consequently
the
distributors
of
earthly
blessings
in
the
shape
of
places

rents

shares

and
such

were
all
his
friends

and
could
not
overlook
one
of
their
own
set

and
oblonsky
had
no
need
to
make
any
special
exertion
to
get
a
lucrative
post


he
had
only
not
to
refuse
things

not
to
show
jealousy

not
to
be
quarrelsome
or
take
offense

all
of
which
from
his
characteristic
good
nature
he
never
did


it
would
have
struck
him
as
absurd
if
he
had
been
told
that
he
would
not
get
a
position
with
the
salary
he
required

especially
as
he
expected
nothing
out
of
the
way

he
only
wanted
what
the
men
of
his
own
age
and
standing
did
get

and
he
was
no
worse
qualified
for
performing
duties
of
the
kind
than
any
other
man


stepan
arkadyevitch
was
not
merely
liked
by
all
who
knew
him
for
his
good
humor

but
for
his
bright
disposition

and
his
unquestionable
honesty


in
him

in
his
handsome

radiant
figure

his
sparkling
eyes

black
hair
and
eyebrows

and
the
white
and
red
of
his
face

there
was
something
which
produced
a
physical
effect
of
kindliness
and
good
humor
on
the
people
who
met
him


aha

stiva

oblonsky

here
he
is


was
almost
always
said
with
a
smile
of
delight
on
meeting
him


even
though
it
happened
at
times
that
after
a
conversation
with
him
it
seemed
that
nothing
particularly
delightful
had
happened

the
next
day

and
the
next

every
one
was
just
as
delighted
at
meeting
him
again


after
filling
for
three
years
the
post
of
president
of
one
of
the
government
boards
at
moscow

stepan
arkadyevitch
had
won
the
respect

as
well
as
the
liking

of
his
fellow
officials

subordinates

and
superiors

and
all
who
had
had
business
with
him


the
principal
qualities
in
stepan
arkadyevitch
which
had
gained
him
this
universal
respect
in
the
service
consisted

in
the
first
place

of
his
extreme
indulgence
for
others

founded
on
a
consciousness
of
his
own
shortcomings

secondly

of
his
perfect
liberalismnot
the
liberalism
he
read
of
in
the
papers

but
the
liberalism
that
was
in
his
blood

in
virtue
of
which
he
treated
all
men
perfectly
equally
and
exactly
the
same

whatever
their
fortune
or
calling
might
be

and
thirdlythe
most
important
pointhis
complete
indifference
to
the
business
in
which
he
was
engaged

in
consequence
of
which
he
was
never
carried
away

and
never
made
mistakes


on
reaching
the
offices
of
the
board

stepan
arkadyevitch

escorted
by
a
deferential
porter
with
a
portfolio

went
into
his
little
private
room

put
on
his
uniform

and
went
into
the
boardroom


the
clerks
and
copyists
all
rose

greeting
him
with
goodhumored
deference


stepan
arkadyevitch
moved
quickly

as
ever

to
his
place

shook
hands
with
his
colleagues

and
sat
down


he
made
a
joke
or
two

and
talked
just
as
much
as
was
consistent
with
due
decorum

and
began
work


no
one
knew
better
than
stepan
arkadyevitch
how
to
hit
on
the
exact
line
between
freedom

simplicity

and
official
stiffness
necessary
for
the
agreeable
conduct
of
business


a
secretary

with
the
goodhumored
deference
common
to
every
one
in
stepan
arkadyevitchs
office

came
up
with
papers

and
began
to
speak
in
the
familiar
and
easy
tone
which
had
been
introduced
by
stepan
arkadyevitch



we
have
succeeded
in
getting
the
information
from
the
government
department
of
penza


here

would
you
care








youve
got
them
at
last


said
stepan
arkadyevitch

laying
his
finger
on
the
paper



now

gentlemen






and
the
sitting
of
the
board
began



if
they
knew


he
thought

bending
his
head
with
a
significant
air
as
he
listened
to
the
report


what
a
guilty
little
boy
their
president
was
half
an
hour
ago



and
his
eyes
were
laughing
during
the
reading
of
the
report


till
two
oclock
the
sitting
would
go
on
without
a
break

and
at
two
oclock
there
would
be
an
interval
and
luncheon


it
was
not
yet
two

when
the
large
glass
doors
of
the
boardroom
suddenly
opened
and
someone
came
in


all
the
officials
sitting
on
the
further
side
under
the
portrait
of
the
tsar
and
the
eagle

delighted
at
any
distraction

looked
round
at
the
door

but
the
doorkeeper
standing
at
the
door
at
once
drove
out
the
intruder

and
closed
the
glass
door
after
him


when
the
case
had
been
read
through

stepan
arkadyevitch
got
up
and
stretched

and
by
way
of
tribute
to
the
liberalism
of
the
times
took
out
a
cigarette
in
the
boardroom
and
went
into
his
private
room


two
of
the
members
of
the
board

the
old
veteran
in
the
service

nikitin

and
the
kammerjunker
grinevitch

went
in
with
him



we
shall
have
time
to
finish
after
lunch


said
stepan
arkadyevitch



to
be
sure
we
shall


said
nikitin



a
pretty
sharp
fellow
this
fomin
must
be


said
grinevitch
of
one
of
the
persons
taking
part
in
the
case
they
were
examining


stepan
arkadyevitch
frowned
at
grinevitchs
words

giving
him
thereby
to
understand
that
it
was
improper
to
pass
judgment
prematurely

and
made
him
no
reply



who
was
that
came
in


he
asked
the
doorkeeper



someone

your
excellency

crept
in
without
permission
directly
my
back
was
turned


he
was
asking
for
you


i
told
him
when
the
members
come
out

then






where
is
he




maybe
hes
gone
into
the
passage

but
here
he
comes
anyway

that
is
he


said
the
doorkeeper

pointing
to
a
strongly
built

broadshouldered
man
with
a
curly
beard

who

without
taking
off
his
sheepskin
cap

was
running
lightly
and
rapidly
up
the
worn
steps
of
the
stone
staircase


one
of
the
members
going
downa
lean
official
with
a
portfoliostood
out
of
his
way
and
looked
disapprovingly
at
the
legs
of
the
stranger

then
glanced
inquiringly
at
oblonsky


stepan
arkadyevitch
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs


his
goodnaturedly
beaming
face
above
the
embroidered
collar
of
his
uniform
beamed
more
than
ever
when
he
recognized
the
man
coming
up



why

its
actually
you

levin

at
last


he
said
with
a
friendly
mocking
smile

scanning
levin
as
he
approached



how
is
it
you
have
deigned
to
look
me
up
in
this
den


said
stepan
arkadyevitch

and
not
content
with
shaking
hands

he
kissed
his
friend



have
you
been
here
long




i
have
just
come

and
very
much
wanted
to
see
you


said
levin

looking
shyly
and
at
the
same
time
angry
and
uneasily
around



well

lets
go
into
my
room


said
stepan
arkadyevitch

who
knew
his
friends
sensitive
and
irritable
shyness

and

taking
his
arm

he
drew
him
along

as
though
guiding
him
through
dangers


stepan
arkadyevitch
was
on
familiar
terms
with
almost
all
his
acquaintances

and
called
almost
all
of
them
by
their
christian
names
old
men
of
sixty

boys
of
twenty

actors

ministers

merchants

and
adjutantgenerals

so
that
many
of
his
intimate
chums
were
to
be
found
at
the
extreme
ends
of
the
social
ladder

and
would
have
been
very
much
surprised
to
learn
that
they
had

through
the
medium
of
oblonsky

something
in
common


he
was
the
familiar
friend
of
everyone
with
whom
he
took
a
glass
of
champagne

and
he
took
a
glass
of
champagne
with
everyone

and
when
in
consequence
he
met
any
of
his
disreputable
chums

as
he
used
in
joke
to
call
many
of
his
friends

in
the
presence
of
his
subordinates

he
well
knew
how

with
his
characteristic
tact

to
diminish
the
disagreeable
impression
made
on
them


levin
was
not
a
disreputable
chum

but
oblonsky

with
his
ready
tact

felt
that
levin
fancied
he
might
not
care
to
show
his
intimacy
with
him
before
his
subordinates

and
so
he
made
haste
to
take
him
off
into
his
room


levin
was
almost
of
the
same
age
as
oblonsky

their
intimacy
did
not
rest
merely
on
champagne


levin
had
been
the
friend
and
companion
of
his
early
youth


they
were
fond
of
one
another
in
spite
of
the
difference
of
their
characters
and
tastes

as
friends
are
fond
of
one
another
who
have
been
together
in
early
youth


but
in
spite
of
this

each
of
themas
is
often
the
way
with
men
who
have
selected
careers
of
different
kindsthough
in
discussion
he
would
even
justify
the
others
career

in
his
heart
despised
it


it
seemed
to
each
of
them
that
the
life
he
led
himself
was
the
only
real
life

and
the
life
led
by
his
friend
was
a
mere
phantasm


oblonsky
could
not
restrain
a
slight
mocking
smile
at
the
sight
of
levin


how
often
he
had
seen
him
come
up
to
moscow
from
the
country
where
he
was
doing
something

but
what
precisely
stepan
arkadyevitch
could
never
quite
make
out

and
indeed
he
took
no
interest
in
the
matter


levin
arrived
in
moscow
always
excited
and
in
a
hurry

rather
ill
at
ease
and
irritated
by
his
own
want
of
ease

and
for
the
most
part
with
a
perfectly
new

unexpected
view
of
things


stepan
arkadyevitch
laughed
at
this

and
liked
it


in
the
same
way
levin
in
his
heart
despised
the
town
mode
of
life
of
his
friend

and
his
official
duties

which
he
laughed
at

and
regarded
as
trifling

but
the
difference
was
that
oblonsky

as
he
was
doing
the
same
as
every
one
did

laughed
complacently
and
goodhumoredly

while
levin
laughed
without
complacency
and
sometimes
angrily



we
have
long
been
expecting
you


said
stepan
arkadyevitch

going
into
his
room
and
letting
levins
hand
go
as
though
to
show
that
here
all
danger
was
over



i
am
very

very
glad
to
see
you


he
went
on



well

how
are
you


eh


when
did
you
come



levin
was
silent

looking
at
the
unknown
faces
of
oblonskys
two
companions

and
especially
at
the
hand
of
the
elegant
grinevitch

which
had
such
long
white
fingers

such
long
yellow
filbertshaped
nails

and
such
huge
shining
studs
on
the
shirtcuff

that
apparently
they
absorbed
all
his
attention

and
allowed
him
no
freedom
of
thought


oblonsky
noticed
this
at
once

and
smiled



ah

to
be
sure

let
me
introduce
you


he
said



my
colleagues
philip
ivanitch
nikitin

mihail
stanislavitch
grinevitch
and
turning
to
levin
a
district
councilor

a
modern
district
councilman

a
gymnast
who
lifts
thirteen
stone
with
one
hand

a
cattlebreeder
and
sportsman

and
my
friend

konstantin
dmitrievitch
levin

the
brother
of
sergey
ivonovitch
koznishev




delighted


said
the
veteran



i
have
the
honor
of
knowing
your
brother

sergey
ivanovitch


said
grinevitch

holding
out
his
slender
hand
with
its
long
nails


levin
frowned

shook
hands
coldly

and
at
once
turned
to
oblonsky


though
he
had
a
great
respect
for
his
halfbrother

an
author
well
known
to
all
russia

he
could
not
endure
it
when
people
treated
him
not
as
konstantin
levin

but
as
the
brother
of
the
celebrated
koznishev



no

i
am
no
longer
a
district
councilor


i
have
quarreled
with
them
all

and
dont
go
to
the
meetings
any
more


he
said

turning
to
oblonsky



youve
been
quick
about
it


said
oblonsky
with
a
smile



but
how

why




its
a
long
story


i
will
tell
you
some
time


said
levin

but
he
began
telling
him
at
once



well

to
put
it
shortly

i
was
convinced
that
nothing
was
really
done
by
the
district
councils

or
ever
could
be


he
began

as
though
some
one
had
just
insulted
him



on
one
side
its
a
plaything

they
play
at
being
a
parliament

and
im
neither
young
enough
nor
old
enough
to
find
amusement
in
playthings

and
on
the
other
side

he
stammered

its
a
means
for
the
coterie
of
the
district
to
make
money

formerly
they
had
wardships

courts
of
justice

now
they
have
the
district
councilnot
in
the
form
of
bribes

but
in
the
form
of
unearned
salary


he
said

as
hotly
as
though
someone
of
those
present
had
opposed
his
opinion



aha


youre
in
a
new
phase
again

i
seea
conservative


said
stepan
arkadyevitch



however

we
can
go
into
that
later




yes

later


but
i
wanted
to
see
you


said
levin

looking
with
hatred
at
grinevitchs
hand


stepan
arkadyevitch
gave
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile



how
was
it
you
used
to
say
you
would
never
wear
european
dress
again


he
said

scanning
his
new
suit

obviously
cut
by
a
french
tailor



ah
